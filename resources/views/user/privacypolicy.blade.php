<h3>Privacy Policy for Twitter X? </h3>

<p> <b>1.</b> It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how its used, and when it’s shared.</p>

<p> <b>What data do you collect about me?<p> </b>
<p>You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.</p>

<p> <b>How do you use my information?<p> </b>
<p>Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service.</p>

<p> <b>How or when do you share my information?<p> </b>
<p>You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.</p>

<p> <b>How long do you keep data?<p> </b>
<p>We keep different types of information for different periods of time :</p> 

<p> <b>1.</b> We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account.</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p> <b>3.</b> Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.</p>
<p> <b>4.</b> Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.</p>
<p> <b>5.</b> We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.

<p> <b>Is X for kids?<p> </b>
<p>Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
